 <h1> How a steam engine works? </h1>
 <h5>A steam engine converts heat energy into mechanical energy using steam pressure. A boiler heats water to create
high-pressure steam, which is then directed into a cylinder. The steam pressure pushes a piston back and forth, and this
reciprocating motion is converted into rotational motion to power machinery</h5>

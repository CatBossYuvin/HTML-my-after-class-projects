       <h3>Fundamentals of CSS</h3>
        <p>Walimunige Yuvin Dulketh Ranaweera has demonstrated commendable progress in the "Fundamentals of CSS" module. He completed all six scheduled classes without any incompletions, showing strong commitment and attendance, with only one class cancellation which is minimal and likely beyond his control. Yuvin has submitted all six projects associated with the module, each receiving the highest rating of 5, which indicates excellent understanding and application of CSS
        concepts like box model properties, pseudo classes, text styling, and cascading effects. This consistent project
        performance reflects his strong coding skill development and creativity in applying CSS properties effectively. His quiz performance is solid, with an average score of 80%, covering quizzes on box model, background effect, and introduction to CSS, though he has one pending quiz on positioning in CSS which needs completion for a full assessment. The in-class activities also show active engagement with practical coding work, reinforcing his learning through hands-on projects such as positioning, advanced selectors, text styling, and background effects. Yuvin exhibits proficient problem-solving skills by successfully completing complex projects and applying theoretical knowledge practically. However, there is
        room for improvement in timely quiz completion and deeper exploration of more advanced CSS positioning techniques.
        Overall, his engagement score is high due to consistent participation, project submission, and quiz performance,
        positioning him well for advancing his CSS and web design knowledge further.</p>
